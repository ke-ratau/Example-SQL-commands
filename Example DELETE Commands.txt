Important Considerations
Backup Data: Always ensure you have a backup of your data before performing delete operations, especially when deleting large amounts of data.
Use Transactions: For critical operations, consider using transactions to ensure that you can roll back changes if something goes wrong.
Check Affected Rows: After executing a delete command, you can check the number of affected rows to ensure that the correct number of records were deleted.
By following these steps and examples, you can safely and efficiently delete data from your MySQL tables using MySQL Workbench.
